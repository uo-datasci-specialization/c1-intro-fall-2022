### Part 1

----

This part of the homework uses [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/)'s [Lord of the Rings tidy data materials](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy). 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)

library(here)
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra) # optional
```
<br>
<br>

#### 1. Create a new RStudio Project and name it `hw_9`
<br>
<br>

#### 2. Within that project, create a new R Markdown document and modify the YAML to: 
* Include your name
* Render to html
* Change the syntax highlighting to any scheme but the default 
* Include code folding
* Include a floating table of contents
  + Use level 1 headers for items (4) through (8) below 
  + Use level 2 headers for your table and plot in (7) below


<br>
<br>

#### 3. Your first code chunk should:
* Be named `setup`
* Set global chunk options for the document to display and evaluate all code, and not display any warnings or messages
* Load all the necessary packages (please don't load packages you do **not** use)
* Include options for this code chunk so it will not display the code or the results from the code. 

<br>
<br>

# 4. Your second code chunk should:
* Be named `data`
* Import the following three data sets, each as separate objects
  + *The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv*
  + *The_Two_Towers.csv*
  + *The_Return_Of_The_King.csv*
    - (These data sets show the **words spoken** by characters of different races and genders in the *Lord of the Ring*s movie trilogy.)
* Combine these three data sets into one data set as a new object named `lotr_untidy`

```{r data}

fotr <- import(here("data", "The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv")) %>% 
  as_tibble()

tt <- import(here("data", "The_Two_Towers.csv"))

rotk <- import(here("data", "The_Return_Of_The_King.csv"))

lotr_untidy <- bind_rows(fotr, tt, rotk) %>% 
  as_tibble() 

```
<br>
<br>

# 5. Describe why the combined data set is not tidy.
<br>
<br>

# 6. Your third code chunk should:
* Have a meaningful name (do not use spaces or capital letters or underscores)
* Tidy the combined data set
* Save the tidy data to the data folder in your project as `lotr_tidy`

```{r tidy-data}

lotr_tidy <- lotr_untidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Female, Male),
    names_to = "Gender",
    values_to = "Words"
  )

export(lotr_tidy, here("data", "lotr_tidy.csv"))
```
<br>
<br>


# 7. Your fourth code chunk should include code that:
* Reads in the *Female.csv* and *Male.csv* files and saves a single tidy data frame to file 
* This should reproduce exactly the `lotr_tidy` data from above
* Compute the total number of words spoken by each race across the entire trilogy.
* Show these results in a table and a figure.

```{r replicate-data}

d <- import(here("data", "Female.csv")) %>% 
  bind_rows(import(here("data", "Male.csv"))) %>% 
  rename(Human = Man) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Elf, Hobbit, Human),
#OR cols = -c(film, Gender)    
    names_to = "Race",
    values_to = "Words"
  ) %>% 
  select(names(lotr_tidy))
#OR select(Film, Race, Gender, Words)

d_summary <- d %>% 
  group_by(Race) %>% 
  summarize(total_words = sum(Words)) 
```

**Total number of words spoken by each race across the entire LOTR trilogy**

## **Table**

```{r table, results='asis'}
d_summary %>% 
  kable(digits = 2,
         col.names = c("Race", "Total Words")) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

## **Figure**

```{r}

d_summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Race, total_words)) +
  geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Total Words Spoken",
       title = "Lord of the Rings Trilogy",
       subtitle = "Total number of words spoken by three races across the movie trilogy")
```
<br>
<br>


#### 8. Let's make messy data. Your fifth code chunk should include code that uses `lotr_tidy` and `pivot_wider()` to:
* Get one variable per `Race.` Save this as an object
* Get one variable per `Gender.` Save this as an object


```{r messy_data}

messy_by_race <- lotr_tidy %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Race, 
    values_from = Words,
  )

messy_by_gender <- lotr_tidy %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Gender, 
    values_from = Words,
  )

```
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Part 2

----
<br>
<br>

#### 1. Tidy the *Project Reads* data

* Load the **Project_Reads_Scores.csv** file
* Remove columns 5-9, 24, and 25
* Filter to remove the rows in *student_id* that represent aggregate summaries
* Tidy the remaining dataset such that a case represents a score and percentage within a unit (i.e., *score* and *percentage* will be separate columns). Take a VERY close look at the data. You will be able to use the `names_sep` argument if you **first** `rename()` two columns. Identify those two columns first. Also, you will need to first `pivot_longer` and then `pivot_wider` in order to tidy properly. In these data, "tidy" is a row for each of the seven *units* for every *student_id*.


```{r q1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(janitor)
library(ggthemes)

theme_set(theme_minimal())

reads <- read_csv(here("data", "Project_Reads_Scores.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()


reads_tidy <- reads %>% 
  select(4, 1:3, 10:23) %>% 
  rename("unit_56_score" = "unit_5_6_score", 
         "unit_56_percent" = "unit_5_6_percent") %>% 
  filter(student_id != "All Students (Average)") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = contains("unit"),
    names_prefix = "unit_",
    names_sep = "_",
    names_to = c("unit", "score_type"),
    values_to = "score",
    values_transform = list(score = as.character)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(score = parse_number(score)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = score_type,
    values_from = score
  )
```
<br>
<br>

#### 2. Produce a summary table of the mean percentage correct for each unit within test sites. Report the summary in a table.

```{r q2}
reads_summary <- reads_tidy %>% 
	group_by(test_site, unit) %>% 
	summarize(percent = mean(percent))

reads_summary %>% 
  kable()
```
