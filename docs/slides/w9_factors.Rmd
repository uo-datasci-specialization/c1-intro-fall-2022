# Revisiting git

## Before we jump in...

#### ...let's revisit git

Talk with neighbor. What do these terms mean?
Talk about them in the order you would encounter them in your workflow 

* *.green[clone]*
* *.green[pull]*
* *.green[stage]*
* *.green[commit]*
* *.green[push]*
* *.green[repo]*
* *.green[remote]*

# Factors
## just the basics

---
# When do we really want factors?

Generally two reasons to declare a factor

1. Only finite number of categories
  + treatment/control
  + income categories
  + performance levels
  + etc.
  
2. Use in modeling

---
# Creating factos

Imagine you have a vector of months

```{r}
months_4 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
```

--

We could store this as a string, but there are issues with this:
* There are only 12 possible months
  + factors will help us weed out values that don't conform to our predefined levels, which helps safeguard against typos, etc.
  
* You can't sort this vector in a meaningful way
  + default is alphabetic sorting

--

```{r}
sort(months_4)
```

---
# Define it as a factor

```{r}
months_4 <- factor(months_4, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))
months_4
```

--

Now we can sort

```{r}
sort(months_4)
```

---
# Accessing and modifying levels

Uset the `levels()` function

--

```{r}
levels(months_4)
```

---
# Provides an error check of sorts

```{r, warning=TRUE}
months_4[5] <- "Jam"
```

--

```{r}
months_4
```

---
# What if we don’t specify levels?

If you define a factor without specifying the levels, it will assign them alphabetically

```{r, results='hide'}
mnths <- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar"))
```

--

```{r}
mnths
```

---
<p style="float: right;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/forcats/master/man/figures/logo.png" width="300" height="300"></p>
# [`{forcats}`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)

* When working with factors, we can use the `{forcats}` package
  + `for cat`egorical variables
  + anagram of factors
  
--

* Part of the `{tidyverse}` so should be good to go

--

* All functions start with `fct_`
  + use the autofill in RStudio

---
# Change level order – `fct_inorder()`

#### In order they are entered
```{r}
(mnths <- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")))
```

--

```{r}
mnths %>% 
  factor(., levels = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec")) %>% 
  sort(.)
```

---
# Change level order – `fct_inorder()`

#### In order they are entered
```{r}
(mnths <- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")))
```

--

```{r}
mnths %>% 
  factor(., levels = c("Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "Dec")) %>% 
  fct_inorder() %>% #<<
  sort(.)
```

---
# Change level order – `fct_infreq()`

#### In order of frequency

```{r}
c("b", "b", "c", "a", "a", "a") %>% 
    fct_infreq() #<<
```

--

This can be **especially** useful for plotting

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x, fct_infreq(y))
```


---
# Investigate factors

* `{tidyverse}` gives you convenient way to evaluate factors
  + `count()`
  + `geom_bar()` or `geom_col())` with `{ggplot2}`

* But don't forget about the base function `unique()`
  + e.g., `unique(df$factor_variable)`

---
# General Social Survey (GSS)

```{r}
forcats::gss_cat
```

---

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  count(partyid)
```

--

```{r}
levels(gss_cat$partyid)
```

---

```{r}
unique(gss_cat$partyid)
```

--

How many `unique` categories are there (if you have a lot)?

```{r}
length(unique(gss_cat$partyid))
```


---

```{r}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(partyid)) +
    geom_bar()
```

---

ggplot(gss_cat, aes(.pink[fct_infreq(]partyid.pink[)])) +
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;geom_bar()
    
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(fct_infreq(partyid))) +

---
# Change level order – `fct_relevel()`

#### Change level order by hand 
  + *probably one I use most*

```{r eval=FALSE}

            "first_level",

# Change level order – `fct_reorder()`

#### Reorder according to another variable

```{r}
(relig_summary <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(relig) %>%

            n = n()))

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Or `mutate()` the factor reorder

# Modifying factor levels – `fct_recode()`

#### Make modifying factors more explicit

`fct_recode(var_name, "new level" = "old level"...`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong" = "Strong republican", #<<
    "Republican, weak" = "Not str republican", #<<
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind, near rep", #<<
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind, near dem", #<<
    "Democrat, weak" = "Not str democrat", #<<
    "Democrat, strong" = "Strong democrat")) %>% #<<
  count(partyid)
```

---
```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong" = "Strong republican", #<<
    "Republican, weak" = "Not str republican", #<<
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind, near rep", #<<
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind, near dem", #<<
    "Democrat, weak" = "Not str democrat", #<<
    "Democrat, strong" = "Strong democrat")) %>% #<<
  count(partyid)
```

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_recode()`

`fct_recode()` can also be used to collapse levels easily

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer", #<<
    "Other"                 = "Don't know", #<<
    "Other"                 = "Other party")) %>% #<<
  count(partyid)
```

---
```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer", #<<
    "Other"                 = "Don't know", #<<
    "Other"                 = "Other party")) %>% #<<
  count(partyid)
```

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_collapse()`

`fct_collapse()` is one of the more useful functions in `{forcats}`

* Collapse all categories into Republican, Democrat, Independent, or Other

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid, #<<
    	Other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
    	Rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    	Ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
    	Dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat")
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
```

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_lump_?()`

#### `fct_lump_?()` – "lump" a bunch of categories together

* `fct_lump_n(factor_variable, n)`:

--
lumps all levels except for the `n` most frequent (or least frequent if `n` < 0) into "Other" level

--

* `fct_lump_min(factor_variable, min)`:

--
lumps levels that appear fewer than `min` times

--

* `fct_lump_prop(factor_variable, prop)`:

--
lumps levels that appear in fewer `prop` $\times$ `n` times

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_lump_n()`

Collapse to `n` = **9** religious groups: top 8 groups plus "Other"

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate(rel = fct_lump_n(relig, 9)) %>% #<<
  count(rel)
```

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_lump_min()`

Collapse to all religious groups that appear less than `min` = 200 into "Other"

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate(rel = fct_lump_min(relig, min = 200)) %>% #<<
  count(rel) 
```

---
# Collapsing levels – `fct_lump_prop()`

Collapse to all religious groups that appear less than `prop` = 10% into "Other"

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate(rel = fct_lump_prop(relig, prop = .10)) %>% #<<
  count(rel) 
```

---
# Missing levels

```{r}
levels(gss_cat$race)
```

--

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  count(race)
```

--

```{r}
table(gss_cat$race)
```

---
# Missing levels

```{r}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
    geom_bar()
```

---
# Missing levels

```{r}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
    geom_bar() +
    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) #<<
```

# Peer Review of Data Prep Script

#### Expectations

Feedback:
1. Note <u>at least three</u> areas of strength

2. Note <u>at least one</u> thing you learned from reviewing their script

3. Note <u>at least one and no more than three</u> areas for improvement

--

Making your code publicly available can feel daunting 
* The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other
* We are all learning
  + Be constructive in your feedback
  + Be kind
* Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated 
  + Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero
