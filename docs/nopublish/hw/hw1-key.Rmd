```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

### Create a RStudio Project on your machine.

* Within the Project create a folder for *data* and *scripts*.
* Download the following two datasets into the project *data* folder.
  + *sesame13.sav*
  + *star.csv*
* Save your lab_1 .Rmd file in your *scripts* folder

### Loading Packages

The code chunk below loads the `{tidyverse}` package. Please also load `{here}`, `{rio}`, and `{janitor}`. 
If you get errors, you probably don't have one of the packages installed yet, so run `install.packages("package_name")` in the console first.

```{r load-tidyverse, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(rio)
library(janitor)
```

Note that you should get some messages printed out below that state all the packages that have been loaded. This is important to pay attention to. It says that both `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}` have been loaded, so you don't need explicit 
calls to those packages.

### Read in the data

Use the code chunk below to:

* Read in *sesame13.sav* using `{here}` and `{rio}`
* Read in *star.csv* using `{here}` and `{readr}`
* Apply the `clean_names()` function to both
* Save each dataset as a separate object

```{r read-data}
sesame <- import(here("data", "sesame13.sav"))

star <- read_csv(here("data", "star.csv"))
```

### `{ggplot2}` Peek

Many packages also include data. We'll focus here on the **mpg** dataset, which comes from `{ggplot2}`. Run the following code to produce a scatterplot 

```{r first-plot, options}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Help documentation

Look at the help documentation for `geom_point()`. Use the help documentation to change the color of the points to "gray70". Start getting in the habit of running code within a code chunk rather than in the text/prose areas.  

In the code chunk below create a second scatterplot with the *mpg* dataset, this time with the number of cylinders displayed on the *x*-axis and the city miles per gallon on the *y*-axis. Also change the color of the points to "gray70".

```{r second-plot}
#?geom_point

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = cty)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70")
```

### Inspecting Data

The *diamonds* dataset is also included with `{ggplot2}`. The code below will show the first six rows of the dataset.

```{r head-diamonds}
head(diamonds)
```

Look at the help documentation and then use the code below to change the number of rows shown to 15.

```{r head-diamonds15}

head(diamonds, 15)
```

Call a similar function that shows the last six rows of the dataset. (Note you may need to look at the same help documentation.)

```{r last-rows}
tail(diamonds)
```

Use any function you want to determine the dimensions of the dataset - i.e., the number of rows and columns.

```{r diamonds-dimensions}
str(diamonds)

diamonds

nrow(diamonds)

ncol(diamonds)

dim(diamonds)
```

Use the pipe operator, `%>%`, along with the `count()` function, to count the rows of each diamond color. 

```{r diamond-colors1}
diamonds %>%
  count(color) 
```

Write the same code as above, but this time use `count()` without the pipe operator

```{r diamond-colors2}
count(diamonds, color) 
```

Be sure to add your name to the top of the document (line 3, in the YAML).

Click the Knit button near the top (with the cute little ball of yarn next to it), and turn in the output (.html file) to Canvas.
